Instead of blogging, I spent forever looking for a good markdown text editor and then an extra few minutes fidgeting around with this theme. I'm not good at using Github and so am doing kind of tiny projects to get comfortable with basic things like push and stuff. This theme is built on top of [John Otander's](https://johno.com/) Pyxill theme.

## Who is this for?

Me. A Windows user with bad eyesight. You'll notice the background is a light tan and the font size is 22px. Everything is pretty much optimized for Windows. All of the fonts used are pre-installed for that OS so this file will be pretty small.
